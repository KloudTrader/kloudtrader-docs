## Leverage Android User Profiles to Sandbox WhatsApp

It is 2019 and Facebook is [integrating its services into a single unified backend](https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/25/tech/facebook-integrating-whatsapp-instagram-messenger/index.html). Illicit [data sharing](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-46618582) and [election scandals](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/mar/17/cambridge-analytica-facebook-influence-us-election) aside, this would significantly affect the privacy of WhatsApp users, perhaps even more for those under the assumption that their personal chat data would remain separate from their public social media profiles. For Android users, there are however methods to mitigate further damages to their privacy by limiting Facebook’s ability to [build virtual profiles](https://www.recode.net/2018/4/20/17254312/facebook-shadow-profiles-data-collection-non-users-mark-zuckerberg).

Android Lollipop (5.0+) and above has a feature known as “User Profiles”, designed to support multi-user sharing of devices and isolating workplace and personal systems. On a 2017 Android flagship device, switching profiles can usually be done in under 3 seconds. We will be using this feature to isolate WhatsApp.

Go to Android > Settings > System > Multiple Users and add a new user. This can also be done by clicking the user profile icon in the notification bar pull-down menu.
